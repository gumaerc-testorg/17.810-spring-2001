#### Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 1 session / week; 2 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

#### Overview and Goals

This course provides an introduction to game theoretic analysis in political science. We study the concepts and models used to analyze political behavior in strategic contexts, including normal and extensive form games, games of incomplete information, repeated games, and bargaining.

#### Prerequisites

Willingness to work hard on unfamiliar materials. Understanding of basic multivariate calculus. The course will occasionally rely on some methods of mathematical proof (e.g., proof by contradiction, proof by induction, etc.), but prior exposure to them is not assumed.

#### Course Requirements

- Problem sets (7) (50% of the final course grade)
- Regular attendance and active participation in lectures and recitation sections. (10%)
- Final problem set (40%)

For details on the problem sets, see the {{% resource_link "1cbb2272-94ba-4392-9a93-23aff55fc065" "Assignments" %}} section.

#### Notes on Academic Integrity

Please respect and follow the rules written at {{% resource_link "cd1c7596-8eda-440f-a790-212ee64d084c" "Academic Integrity: A Handbook for Students" %}}. 

In particular, the following is a (partial) list of the acts we will consider academically dishonest:

- Obtaining or consulting course materials from previous years
- Sharing course materials with people outside of the class, such as problem sets and solutions
- Copying and pasting someone else’s answers to problem sets electronically, even if you collaborated with the person in a legitimate way (as specified above)

#### Recitation Sessions

We will hold weekly recitation sessions. These sessions will provide a review of the class material and also help with problem sets. The teaching assistant will run the sessions and can give more details. Attendance is strongly encouraged.

#### Books

**Required Book**

There will be required readings for each section of the course. Students are expected to complete them before the relevant materials are covered in the lectures. The following textbook is required and will be used throughout the course.
